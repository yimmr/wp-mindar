== Description ==
Wordpress augmented reality plugin is based on AR.js and can be used to integrate marker based augmented reality on your wordpress (https only) site with images and gltf files. Only works on https sites.

The most simple explanation for the term "Marked based augmented reality" is that you have to print the marker images, place them in your physical environment and then point the camera on them for displaying the augmented reality objects, this can be very useful for the above applications:

    Training and educational
    Product marketing
    Engineering intructions
    And more

=  How to Use  =
 The main function of this plugin is to create a shortcode-button where you can paste anywhere in your site, this shortcode-button will link to a dynamic created new page where the augmented reality will run. For creating the shortcode you can run the editor at the shortcode creator page, just choose a marker (pattern) and an object(image or gltf model), then click on the create shortcode button, a shortcode will be created,copy and paste the shortcode at your page and a button will appear on the frontend page with the link for the augmented reality page, ,finally print the picture of the matching previous selected marker from the images folder at the file manager menu and run the page from a device with camera (laptop, android phone).
